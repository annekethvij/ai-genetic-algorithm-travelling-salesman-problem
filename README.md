# ai-genetic-algorithm-travelling-salesman-problem
3D Travelling-Salesman Problem (TSP) Implementation using Genetic Algorithm with Roulette wheel-based parent selection and a two point crossover.
I/O specifications as below: 
Input: The program expects an input.txt file with the first line denoting the number of cities(n) in a 3D space and the next "n" line contains their respective non-negative coordinates.
Output: The program stores the results in output.txt file with the first line list the computed distance of the path and the subsequent "n+1" lines list the 3D coordinates of the cities visited, in the order they were visited. This includes starting and ending at the same city, hence the "n+1" notation in the line count.
